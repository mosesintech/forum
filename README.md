This is going to be my jab at creating a full stack forum web app from scratch.

I decided to start with Create React App to give me a quick start to putting it together. I wanted to design the app before I started working on the logic. For this, I used SCSS. I realized from the start that I would need an advanced way of handling state, so I set up Redux after I designed the landing page.
